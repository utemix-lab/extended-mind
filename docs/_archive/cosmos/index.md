# Cosmos Map

Cosmos Map is a canonical graph of the extended-mind ecosystem.

Why it exists:
- keep a single view of projects, layers, artifacts, actors
- support navigation and reasoning without changing the KB pipeline

Author mode vs viewer mode:
- author mode: edit and export JSON, then commit to repo
- viewer mode: read-only visualization

RAG note:
- the map can be used alongside RAG, but is not part of the dataset
