# Step Record v1

step_id: S-2026-01-28-01
intent: Consolidate living-book narrative layer and align workbench headers
goals: [UG-5], [LG-5], [MG-1]
mechanisms_touched: SYSTEM_GOALS, MECHANISMS_TO_GOALS, story-nodes, coverage-map-full, workbench headers
artifacts_changed: coverage-map-full, SYSTEM_GOALS, MECHANISMS_TO_GOALS, new story-nodes, workbench docs
user_visible_change: Coverage map reads as a book-map with updated workbench types/slogans
guardrails_checked:
- [x] catalog rows ≠ nodes
- [x] visual ≠ navigation
- [x] projections ≠ entities
- [x] canon stays minimal
next_question: Sync narrative mirrors and CHARACTERS layer to new book-map?
